# Claude Code setup: what is in the repo, what you do on your machine

The repo already carries the team setup (dojo Day 01-10, Jira epic KAN-9). This page lists what it does and the steps each developer runs locally, because they need your own login, secrets or machine.

## What the repo gives you

| Path                                       | What it does                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CLAUDE.md`                                | Team rules loaded into every session: commands, layout, conventions, never-do list.                                             |
| `.claude/settings.json`                    | Permissions (allow / ask / deny) and the two hooks below.                                                                       |
| `.claude/hooks/block-forbidden.mjs`        | Before each Bash command: blocks push to `main`, force-push, `--no-verify`, Claude trailers in commits, shell access to `.env`. |
| `.claude/hooks/format-on-edit.mjs`         | After each Edit/Write: `eslint --fix` on JS/TS files, then Prettier, using the repo's own config.                               |
| `.claude/agents/bug-investigator.md`       | Read-only subagent that reproduces a bug and reports the root cause with `file:line`.                                           |
| `.claude/skills/review-checklist/`         | Team review checklist, used by `/code-review` style reviews and before merging.                                                 |
| `.claude/commands/standup.md`              | `/standup [since]`: drafts a standup from your commits and KAN tickets (see below).                                             |
| `.mcp.json`                                | Playwright MCP to open and check the app on http://localhost:3000; output goes to the ignored `.playwright-mcp/`.               |
| `docs/review-false-positives.md`           | Review findings that are by design; add rows during Day 10 and the retro.                                                       |
| `.github/workflows/claude.yml`             | GitHub Action: runs Claude when an issue or PR comment mentions `@claude`.                                                      |
| `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` | GitHub Action: reviews every opened or updated PR with the `code-review` plugin and posts inline comments.                      |

Use Node.js 24 (the app's `engines`, also what Vercel builds with) and pnpm (`corepack enable` once picks the version in `packageManager`). After pulling, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (installs exactly the lock file; `pnpm install` may rewrite it), then restart Claude Code so it loads the new settings.

## `/standup`

`/standup` (or `/standup last friday`) reads `git log` for commits by your git email since the given day (default: yesterday), groups them by KAN key, and, when the Atlassian connector is on, adds the status of those tickets and your In Progress tickets. It prints three short sections, **Done**, **Today** and **Blockers**, to read aloud. It only reads; it never posts anywhere. Edit `.claude/commands/standup.md` to change the format.

## Steps to do on your machine

### 0. Install the command-line tools (once)

Steps 3 and 4 run `claude` and `gh` in a terminal, so both must be on your `PATH`.

1. Claude Code CLI. The `claude.exe` bundled with Claude Desktop lives in a versioned folder that changes on every app update, so install the standalone CLI instead:
   - Windows (PowerShell): `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
   - macOS: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
2. GitHub CLI, used by `/install-github-app` to add the repo secret and open the workflow PR:
   - Windows: `winget install --id GitHub.cli`
   - macOS: `brew install gh`
3. Open a new terminal, run `gh auth login` (GitHub.com, HTTPS, log in with a web browser) with the account that owns the repo.
4. Check with `claude --version` and `gh auth status`.

### 1. Approve the project settings (once)

1. Open the repo in Claude Code (Desktop Code tab or `claude` in a terminal).
2. Accept the prompt to trust the project and enable the `playwright` MCP server.
3. Check with `/hooks` (both hooks listed), `/mcp` (playwright connected) and `/agents` (bug-investigator listed).

### 2. Notify-on-finish (personal, per machine)

Create `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored) with a `Stop` hook for your OS.

macOS:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "osascript -e 'display notification \"Claude is done\" with title \"pt-app\"'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "powershell -NoProfile -Command \"[console]::beep(800,300)\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Restart the session and finish any prompt to test it.

### 3. GitHub connector (Day 08)

GitHub's MCP endpoint does not support the automatic OAuth sign-in (`/mcp` shows "does not support dynamic client registration"), so use a personal access token.

1. On GitHub: Settings > Developer settings > Fine-grained tokens > Generate. Repository access: only `pt-app`; permissions: Contents read, Pull requests read and write, Issues read and write. Copy the token; never paste it into a chat or a repo file.
2. Store it as a user environment variable `GITHUB_PAT` (Windows: System Properties > Environment Variables; macOS: `export GITHUB_PAT=...` in `~/.zshrc`), then open a new terminal.
3. Add the server at user scope, so the repo's `.mcp.json` stays unchanged. If an earlier attempt added it, run `claude mcp remove github -s user` first.
   `claude mcp add --scope user --transport http github https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/ --header "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_PAT"` (PowerShell: `$env:GITHUB_PAT`)
4. `claude mcp list` should show `github: ✓ Connected`.
5. Test it: ask Claude to list open PRs in `hoanhoang-agilityio/pt-app` and comment on one.

### 4. `@claude` in GitHub Actions (Day 09)

Already done for this repo (PR #4): both workflows above are on `main` and use the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` repo secret. Repeat these steps only for a new repo or to rotate the secret.

1. Make sure step 0 is done (`gh auth status` shows you logged in); otherwise `/install-github-app` warns that GitHub CLI is missing.
2. In Claude Code inside this repo, run `/install-github-app`.
3. Pick the workflows: **@Claude Code** (on mention) and **Claude Code Review** (auto review on every PR).
4. Install the Claude GitHub App on the repo and let it add the secret: sign in with your Claude account (OAuth token) on a Pro/Max plan, or use an API key. Never paste the key or token into a file or chat.
5. Merge the workflow PR it opens.
6. Test it: comment `@claude review this PR` on a PR, or open an issue that mentions `@claude`, and evaluate the result in the Actions tab.

Auto review runs on every push to every PR and uses your Claude quota. To limit it, uncomment the `paths:` filter in `claude-code-review.yml` or delete that file.

### 5. Hands-on exercises (no repo change needed)

| Day | Exercise                                                                                                         |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D04 | Cycle permission modes with Shift+Tab (Windows: Alt+M); run one KAN ticket through plan mode to PR.              |
| D05 | `/memory`, `/compact` on a long session, Esc Esc to `/rewind` a bad edit; compare a fresh vs a warmed session.   |
| D06 | `/loop 15m` on your PR, `/rc` and steer from the phone, two tickets in parallel with `claude --worktree <name>`. |
| D07 | `/plugin`, install one plugin (e.g. a TypeScript LSP), write down an honest verdict.                             |
| D09 | `/goal` on a bounded task; a Local routine in Desktop (Code tab > Routines > New routine > Local).               |
| D10 | `/code-review` on a real branch, `/code-review ultra` on a seeded-bug branch, `/security-review` before commit.  |
